#Animal Health Classification App
This is a simple *machine learning web app* built using *Streamlit. It predicts the **health status of animals* based on symptoms using a trained *Support Vector Machine (SVM)* model.
#HOW IT WORKS
1. The app takes input for 5 types of symptoms:
   - Blood/Brain Disease
   - Appearance Disease
   - General Disease
   - Lung Disease
   - Abdominal Disease
     
     2. It uses a pre-trained SVM model (best_model.pkl) to predict one of the health statuses:
   - Healthy
   - Moderately Sick
   - Severely Sick

      - Model Used:Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Dataset: Provided for project (not included due to privacy)
- Training Language:Python
- Libraries Used: scikit-learn, pandas, joblib, streamlit
